# Demo Data Scripts

This directory contains scripts to create comprehensive demo data for Sous Agent.

## üé≠ Demo Account Overview

The demo data creates a fully functional chef account with:
- **5 Diverse Clients** with realistic preferences and dietary requirements
- **15 Sample Recipes** across multiple cuisines (Mediterranean, Asian, American, Mexican, French)
- **Sample Feedback History** to demonstrate AI learning capabilities

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Demo Authentication User

First, create the demo user through Supabase Auth dashboard or use the auth API:

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - Click "Add user"
   - Email: `demo@sousagent.com`
   - Password: `DemoChef2024!`
   - Confirm email: ‚úÖ (check the box)

2. **Via SQL (Alternative):**
   ```sql
   -- This creates the auth user directly (use with caution)
   INSERT INTO auth.users (
     id, email, encrypted_password, email_confirmed_at, created_at, updated_at, 
     email_confirm_token, recovery_token, raw_app_meta_data, raw_user_meta_data
   ) VALUES (
     gen_random_uuid(),
     'demo@sousagent.com',
     crypt('DemoChef2024!', gen_salt('bf')),
     now(),
     now(), 
     now(),
     '',
     '',
     '{"provider":"email","providers":["email"]}',
     '{}'
   );
   ```

### Step 2: Get the User UUID

After creating the auth user, get their UUID:

```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'demo@sousagent.com';
```

Copy the UUID (something like: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`)

### Step 3: Update the Demo Script

Edit `create-demo-data.sql` and replace the placeholder UUID on line 13:

```sql
-- Replace this line:
demo_chef_id uuid := 'aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee'; -- REPLACE WITH ACTUAL UUID

-- With your actual UUID:
demo_chef_id uuid := '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'; -- Your actual UUID
```

### Step 4: Run the Demo Script

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `create-demo-data.sql`
4. Click "RUN" to execute the script
